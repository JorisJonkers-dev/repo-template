# Bootstrapping a new JorisJonkers-dev repo from this template

1. **Create the repo from the template** (GitHub "Use this template", or
   `gh repo create JorisJonkers-dev/<name> --template JorisJonkers-dev/repo-template
   --private`).
2. **Apply the branch ruleset** so `Pipeline Complete` is required:
   ```bash
   scripts/apply-ruleset.sh JorisJonkers-dev/<name>
   ```
3. **Wire the real CI**: replace the placeholder `lint`/`test`/`coverage`/`build`
   jobs in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` with this repo's actual jobs, or copy the
   nearest caller template from `templates/workflows/`. Keep the
   `pipeline-complete` aggregator and list every gating job in its `needs:`.
4. **Wire the coverage gate**: every repo must enforce **>=80% line coverage**.
   - Gradle: apply JaCoCo and run `jacocoTestCoverageVerification` with a line
     coverage minimum of `0.80`.
   - Node: run Vitest with c8 coverage enforcement, for example `c8 --lines 80
     vitest run`.
5. **Set the release artifact**: edit `release.yml`'s `publish` job for this
   repo's artifact type (Maven / npm / image), and set `release-type` in
   `release-please-config.json` accordingly. New GitHub Packages publish as
   public on this account, but verify package visibility after the first
   publish.
6. **Set the starting version** in `.release-please-manifest.json`.
7. **Install private-repo hooks** when GitHub branch protection is process-gated:
   ```bash
   scripts/install-git-hooks.sh
   ```
8. **CODEOWNERS / README**: adjust owners and replace this README's body with
   the repo's purpose.
9. **Choose dependency policy depth**:
   - Keep the root `renovate.json` and `.github/dependabot.yml` for the default
     JorisJonkers-dev policy.
   - Copy richer stack-specific variants from `templates/dependency-policy/`
     when the repo needs Dependabot ecosystems, dependency-review, Scorecard, or
     advanced CodeQL setup.
10. **Choose root tooling presets** from `templates/root-tooling/` when the repo
   has frontend linting, local hooks, Stryker mutation testing, ADRs, or docs
   indexes.
11. **Opt into platform/deploy config validation** only for repos that carry
    platform config: copy
    `templates/platform-config-validation/platform-config-validate.yml.tmpl` to
    `.github/workflows/platform-config-validate.yml`. It calls
    `JorisJonkers-dev/github-workflows/.github/workflows/platform-config-validate.yml@v0.7.3`
    with `schema-kind: auto` and platform/deploy YAML globs.
12. **Opt into Project, hygiene, or deploy bundle callers** by copying the
    relevant file from `templates/workflows/` after replacing
    `{{github_workflows_ref}}` with a published `github-workflows` tag. The
    reusable workflow must exist at that tag.
13. **Review Docker pattern skeletons** in `templates/docker-patterns/` only as
    design references. They are not production Dockerfiles.
14. **Validate template assets**:
    ```bash
    scripts/validate-templates.sh
    ```
